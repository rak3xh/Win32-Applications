## Introduction

This repository contains a series of Win32 applications created using C++ and Visual Studio. These examples are intended to provide a solid foundation for learning Win32 API programming and to serve as a reference for developers working with Windows desktop applications.

## Features

- **Basic Win32 Application Structure**: Understand the fundamental structure of a Win32 application.
- **GUI Components**: Examples of common GUI components like buttons, text boxes, and menus.
- **Event Handling**: Demonstrations of handling various events and messages.
- **File I/O**: Examples of file operations within a Win32 application.
- **Advanced Topics**: More complex examples, including multithreading and custom drawing.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rak3xh/Win32-Applications.git
   ```
2. **Open the Solution in Visual Studio**:

   - Navigate to the cloned repository directory.
   - Open the `.sln` (solution) file with Visual Studio.

3. **Build and Run**:
   - Build the project using `Build` -> `Build Solution` in Visual Studio.
   - Run the application using `Debug` -> `Start Debugging` or by pressing `F5`.

## Examples

The repository contains the following examples:

- **Money Denominator Calculator**: An application that calculates the minimum number of currency notes and coins needed to make a given amount. It provides a user-friendly interface to input the amount and select the available denominations.
- **SnakeXezia Game**: A classic Snake game with a unique twist. The game allows players to control a snake using arrow keys, collecting food items to grow the snake and avoid collisions with the game boundaries or itself.

Each example is contained within its own directory with a corresponding Visual Studio project.
